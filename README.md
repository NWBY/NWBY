### Hey! :soccer:

I'm [Sam](https://twitter.com/SamNewby_), a full-stack developer from the UK. I currently work at [Tails.com](https://tails.com) where I work mostly with Python, Flask and Vue.js. Currently, I'm focusing on improving my Python & Rust knowledge.

I love learning new languages, frameworks and technologies and so I'm frequently challenging myself to build different projects. Some of the things that I've worked on recently:
- [Pit](https://github.com/NWBY/pit) - CLI written in Python that simplifies common Git commands
- [Prototype Blockchain](https://github.com/NWBY/hackday-blockchain) - A prototype proof-of-work blockchain written in Python. This is still a WIP ðŸš§
- [Panther](https://github.com/NWBY/panther) - Lightweight programming language written in Go. This project is on hold indefinitely whilst I explore other projects.
- [Text Editor](https://github.com/NWBY/hackday-editor) - A terminal based text editor written in Go
