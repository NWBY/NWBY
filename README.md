### Hey! :soccer:

I'm [Sam](https://twitter.com/SamNewby_), a full-stack developer from the UK. I currently work at Brambles where I work mostly with Go, TypeScript and Svelte. Outside of work, I'm focussed on TypeScript, React and a little bit of Zig.

I've built a bunch of toy projects which I've probably abandoned by now. I'm currently building:
* [cftop](https://github.com/NWBY/cftop) which is a TUI for monitoring and exploring your Cloudflare Workers and associated tools such as D1, KV, R2 and many more.
