### Hey! :soccer:

I'm [Sam](https://twitter.com/SamNewby_), a full-stack developer from the UK. I currently work at [Nimbus Hosting](https://nimbushosting.co.uk) where I work mostly with Laravel and Vue.js.

You can find my website at [sam.nwby.io](https://sam.nwby.io) where I try to write content that is worth your time. Currently, I'm focusing on learning Rust and trying to contribute to open source projects more.
